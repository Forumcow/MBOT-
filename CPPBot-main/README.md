# Usage
It should be easy to build this, but apparently visual studio wouldn't allow you to. Because sometimes thing could go wrong
so I'd recommend to use **Visual Studio 2019** because its the version that I'm currently using

1. Change this [line](https://github.com/inf7/CPPBot/blob/9439630fbb67fc11c5a89d62408e0db5fa9fa71a/CPPBot/CPPBot.cpp#L35) to your exact path of the `.json` make sure you have double slash
2. Build in debug mode or release, up to you
3. Enjoy

**Bot data example**
```json
{
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password",
  "gameVersion": "version",
  "targetWorld": "world",
  "ownerUsername": "ownername"
}
```
